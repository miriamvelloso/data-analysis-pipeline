    "    - Separate code into other `.py` files. Create functions or classes if needed.\n",
    "  - It must receive at least 2 params via command-line flags `--param1` `--param2`.\n",
    "    - Use `argparse` for this task.\n",
    "    - Those parameters should be used to filter the dataset.\n",
    "- C) Filter the dataset with the params received from `main.py`\n",
    "  - Note: You can clean the dateset beforehand in another script/notebook or do it directly in the `main.py` execution\n",
    "- D) Enrich the dataset with external data, you have to choose at least one of the following:\n",
    "  - L1) Get data from an API.\n",
    "  - L2) Use an API that requires authentication via token or oAuth.\n",
    "  - L3) Do basic web scraping with python `requests` module.\n",
    "  - L4) Perform advanced web scraping with `selenium`.\n",
    "- E) Create some reports containing valuable data from the dataset. You have to choose at least one of the following:\n",
    "  - L1) Simply sumarize the data and do some basic statistics \\(`mean`, `max`, `min`, `std`, etc.).\n",
    "  - L2) Do domain based statistics or data aggregations using `groupby()` .\n",

    "  - L1) Simple text report that will be printed in console `stdout` using `print()`.\n",
    "  - L2) Create a PDF file `report.pdf` with your text report and plots.\n",
    "  - L3) Send a mail using python `smtplib` library to someone. Add a `--mailto` flag in your `main.py` and include a text report inside the mail.\n",
    "  - L4) 🚧HARD MODE:🚧 Mail with PDF file attatched and plots inside pdf file.\n",
    "- **G**) **NEW SEASON THIS BOOTCAMP** Advanced Mailing techniques\n",
    "  - L1) 🚴🏻‍♂️ Generate a HTML email with embedded images & visual report\n",
    "  - L2) 🚀 Use a mail sending service `API`. `Sengrid` Free plan allows 40k emails/day with it's free plan.\n",
    "- **E**) 🔥AMAZING🔥 Get an automatic `Slack` message every time someone opens an email with your report.🤷🏼‍♂️ Use the slack api for this.\n",
